	 * Composite design pattern is a partitioning design pattern. 
	 * It describes that a group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single
	 * instance of an object.
	 * The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
	 * Implementing thos pattern lets clients treat individual objectas and compositions uniformly.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Here in this example we have sentences composed of words composed of letters. All of these objects can be treated through the same interface - LetterComposite
