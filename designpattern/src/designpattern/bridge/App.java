/**
 * 
 * Bridge Design Pattern--
 * Composition over Inheritance.
 * The Bridge pattern can also be thought of as two layers of abstraction.
 * With this, you can decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently
 * 
 * In this example i am going to have two class hierarchies. One of weapons and another one of enchantments.
 * We can easily combine any weapon with any enchantments using composition instead of creating deep class hierarchy.
 * 
 * In Bridge pattern both abstraction (Weapon) and implementation(Enchantment) have their own class hierarchies.The interface of the implementations
 * can be changed without affecting the clients
 *
